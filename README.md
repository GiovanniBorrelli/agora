## System Purpose
The purpose of the system is to provide social activism communities with a unique platform where they can engage collectively online, posting events, news, and communicating with each other.

The project has been developed based on the theme of <b><i>Engaging Community and Inclusion.</i></b> After selecting the target group, an analysis of the chosen community was conducted, followed by the system design and ultimately its implementation.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
